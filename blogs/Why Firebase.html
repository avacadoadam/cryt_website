                    <p>
                        Having an app for your business is becoming more important, especially depending on your
                        industry.</p>
                    <p>
                        The fact is that many users like to know that they can gain access to everything they need
                        to
                        interact with your business on a mobile app rather than having to use a mobile page on their
                        smartphone or tablet.
                    </p>
                    <a name="What"></a>
                    <h2>What is Firebase?</h2>
                    <p>Google’s Firebase is a mobile platform that lets you develop mobile apps. It is especially geared
                        towards business apps, with the intention of helping businesses grow their user bases and
                        increase
                        their profits through their mobile apps. The screenshot from Google Firebase below shows just
                        some
                        of the features that are a part of Firebase, again, with the intention of developing, growing
                        and
                        earning:</p>
                    <p>Let’s look closer at four features that make this platform essential:</p>
                    <h3>1. Incredibly Built-In Analytics</h3>
                    <p>One of the best features of Firebase is the Analytics dashboard that it comes equipped with. It
                        is
                        free and has the capacity to report 500 event types, each with up to 25 attributes. The
                        dashboard is
                        really top notch for looking at user behavior and measuring various user attributions.
                        Ultimately it
                        helps you understand how people use your app so you can better optimize it in the future. You
                        can
                        learn more about the importance of app optimization .</p>
                    <a name="KeyFeatures"></a>
                    <h4>Key features:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Unlimited Reporting</strong>. Firebase allows for reporting of 500 distinct events.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Audience Segmentation</strong>. You can identify custom audiences can in the
                            Firebase
                            console based on device data, custom events, or user properties. Then you can use these
                            audiences that you have specified with other Firebase features when targeting new features
                            or
                            notifications.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Integration with Other Services</strong>. You can integrate Firebase with other
                            services
                            that your business app can utilize such as Big Query, Firebase CrashReporting, Firebase
                            Notifications, Firebase Remote Configuration and Google Tag Manager.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <a name="Why"></a>
                    <h4>Why is this so essential?</h4>
                    <p>Firebase Analytics gives you undeniable insight into user behavior. You can use this knowledge to
                        make informed decisions about how to market your app better and to reach out to the audiences
                        that
                        you want to target. The unique features it offers also allows you to analyze the performance of
                        your
                        campaigns across organic and paid channels to understand which methods are most effective in
                        regards
                        to the specific users that you want to reach.</p>
                    <h3>2. App Development Made Easy</h3>
                    <p>With Firebase, you can focus your time and attention on developing the best app(s) possible for
                        your
                        business. Since the operations and internal functions are so solid, and taken care of by the
                        Firebase interface, you can spend more time developing the high quality app that users are going
                        to
                        want to use.</p>

                          target="_blank">Some
                        of the features you can develop include</a>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Cloud Messaging</strong>: Deliver and receive messages in a more reliable way across
                            platforms

                        <li>
                            <strong>Authentication</strong>: Have a lot less friction with acclaimed authentication
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Hosting</strong>: Deliver web content faster

                            <strong>Crash Reporting</strong>: Keep your app stable

                            <strong>Storage</strong>: File storing made easy
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <a name="Growth"></a>
                    <h3>3. Growth and User Engagement</h3>
                    <p>One of the most important aspects of app development is being able to grow and engage with users
                        over
                        the course of time. Firebase has a lot of built in features to make sure this is exactly what
                        you
                        do. With the platform being geared towards business apps, this is really at the center of what
                        makes
                        Firebase so great.</p>
                    <p>Here are some of the user engagement aspects that make growth a piece of cake:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>AdWords.</strong> It is super easy to link AdWords, and with that you have the
                            ability
                            to segment and define your user base using Firebase Analytics. With this it is easy to
                            improve
                            your targeting in marketing ad campaigns. Some of the other benefits include conversion
                            tracking, cross-network attribution network, and LTV (calculate Customer Lifetime Value).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>App Indexing</strong><strong>. </strong>With app indexing you can work on aspects
                            like
                            re-engaging with your app, especially by surfacing in-app content within Google Search
                            results.
                            This will also help your app ranking overall in the Google Search results.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Dynamic Links</strong><strong>. </strong>Dynamic Links are smart URLs that
                            dynamically
                            change behavior to provide the best experience across different platforms. This allows app
                            users
                            to be taken directly to content of interest to them once they install the app – it doesn't
                            matter if they are a totally new or a lifetime customer. You can see why this feature is
                            awesome
                            for making content easy and super relevant for all of your users.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Invites</strong><strong>. </strong>The perfect tool for referrals and sharing. Get
                            your
                            users to help grow your app (and business) through allowing your existing users easily share
                            your app, or in-app content, via email or SMS. If you use this feature in conjunction with
                            promotions you can also work towards gaining new customers and retaining your existing
                            customers.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Notifications</strong><strong>. </strong>You can very easily manage notification
                            campaigns, including having the ability to set and schedule messages in order to engage
                            users at
                            the right times of day. These notifications are totally free and unlimited for both Android
                            and
                            iOS. There is only one dashboard to worry about, and if you integrate with Firebase
                            Analytics
                            you can use a variety of user segmentation features.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <a name="Earnings"></a>
                    <h3>4. Increase Your Earnings</h3>
                    <p>Of course, the point of having an app or any other business strategy is to increase your
                        earnings,
                        and with the feature AdMob you can monetize your app while still considering the best possible
                        experience for your users. By showing ads from millions of Google advertisers in real time,
                        choosing
                        a format to suit your app, and working with more than 40 top ad networks using AdMob Mediation
                        you
                        can be making app development well worth your while monetarily speaking. You can also
                        cross-promote
                        between your apps for free with AdMob house ads!</p>
                    <h4>All the Information You Need</h4>
                    <p>One of my favorite aspects of Firebase is that there is so much support no matter what system you
                        are
                        using to develop your app.</p>
                    <a name="takeaway"></a>
                    <h2>Google Firebase: The Takeaway</h2>
                    <p>If you have a business app or are considering starting one, look no further than Firebase. This
                        interface literally has everything you could possibly need to start a successful business app or
                        launch your current design forward in the right direction. Between analytics, development,
                        growth,
                        and money-making considerations, you are going to be set with this platform for a long time of
                        continued success.</p>
